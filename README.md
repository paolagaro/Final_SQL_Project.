# Final_SQL_Project.
This is an analysis of the arrests in the city of New your from January 2025 to October 2024 as part of my final project for the SQL class. 

Using the 'NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date)' database from data.gov take a reakdown of every arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD during the current year 2024 in order to know what were the most common causes of arrests in NYC and how these have been classified. 

I Create 3 different tables with the database, one to identify each arrest classification, the descriptions of the crimes. by sex, ages and races.
The most common reason for arrests is 'ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES' with a total of 28,892 cases so far this year, rape arrests are in 28th position with a total of 571 cases mostly committed by individuals with an average age of 27 years old. The total number of male arrests exceeds that of females with 125,327, indicating a higher rate of violence in males. The 109th precinct is the one that receives the highest number of arrests for 'ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES' in Manhattan

Crime and violence have been the number 1 reason for arrest in New York City in the year 2024 and not arrests for rape, for the most part these arrests for violence are carried out against male individuals, which shows, In this city the chances of being beaten are higher than being robbed.
